<ul>
<li>first, how the course is organized</li>
<li>then introduction to competition policy</li>
<li>Massimo Motta, 2004, <em>Competition Policy: theory and practice</em>, Cambridge University Press.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="expectations" class="slide level2">
<h1>expectations</h1>
<ul>
<li>we expect you to prepare each lecture</li>
<li>when Jan teaches:
<ul>
<li>watch video lecture beforehand</li>
<li>prepare exercises discussed in class</li>
</ul></li>
<li>when Lapo teaches:
<ul>
<li>read material beforehand</li>
</ul></li>
<li>attend guest lectures/Tilec seminars</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="grade" class="slide level2">
<h1>grade</h1>
<ul>
<li>your grade is the average of
<ul>
<li>3 assignments</li>
<li>1 exam</li>
</ul></li>
<li>each has the same weight (25%)</li>
<li>assignments are mandatory</li>
<li>one assignment: empirical</li>
<li>two assignments: programming</li>
<li>grades for assignments can only be used this academic year</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="assignments" class="slide level2">
<h1>assignments</h1>
<ul>
<li>assignments can be done alone or in a team of 2 students</li>
<li>for the empirical assignment you analyse a dataset</li>
<li>for the programming assignments, you will do simulations</li>
<li>during the lectures, I will show you how to program in python</li>
<li>I know this is new for (most of) you</li>
<li>with python we can bring the theory to life</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="python" class="slide level2">
<h1>python</h1>
<ul>
<li>good idea to look into python in the following weeks</li>
<li>when you get stuck, you can google</li>
<li>but some basic knowledge saves you a lot of time!</li>
<li>with python notebooks you can program and explain what you do in the same file</li>
<li>learn a bit of markdown and latex</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="details" class="slide level2">

<section><section id="competition-law" class="titleslide slide level1"><h1>Competition law</h1></section><section id="eu-law" class="slide level2">
<h1>EU law</h1>
<ul>
<li>EU law is structured as follows:
<ul>
<li><strong>Article 101</strong>: agreements between firms
<ul>
<li><em>horizontal agreements</em>: cartels, collusion, joint ventures</li>
<li><em>vertical agreements</em>: manufacturer and wholesaler or wholesaler and retailer</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Article 102</strong>: abuse of a dominant position
<ul>
<li>price discrimination, predatory behavior, tying and bundling, refusal to supply</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Merger Regulation</strong>: when one firm plans to acquire another firm, the Commission has to be notified</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="why-needed" class="slide level2">
<h1>why needed?</h1>
<ul>
<li>economists tend to believe that markets work well</li>
<li>welfare theorems: Pareto efficient allocations</li>
<li>why do we need a competition authority (CA)?</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="imperfections" class="slide level2">
<h1>imperfections</h1>
<ul>
<li>welfare theorems assume firms are price takers</li>
<li>in real world firms have (market) power to set prices</li>
<li>first year micro: monopolist setting prices leads to deadweight loss</li>
<li>under total welfare standard: welfare loss equals deadweight loss (<span class="math">\(DWL\)</span>)</li>
<li>under consumer welfare standard: loss equals <span class="math">\(DWL+PS\)</span></li>
<li>CA tries to prevent monopolies from emerging through mergers</li>
<li>when firm is dominant, CA tries to prevent firm from abusing this position</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="objective-ca" class="slide level2">
<h1>objective CA</h1>
<ul>
<li>EU and US tend to put more emphasis on CS than on PS
<ul>
<li>firms can fight for themselves</li>
<li>harder to organize consumers because of free riding problems</li>
<li>against: consumers are also shareholders</li>
</ul></li>
<li>EU every now and again states as a goal promotion of market integration
<ul>
<li>political objective; hard to formalize in economics</li>
<li>EU forbids price discrimination across national borders</li>
<li>but from economic point of view can be welfare enhancing</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section></section>
<section><section id="market-power" class="titleslide slide level1"><h1>market power</h1></section><section id="efficiency" class="slide level2">
<h1>efficiency</h1>
<ul>
<li>Nickell (JPE, 1996): firms with market power are less efficient
<ul>
<li>with market power, less reason to ''worry''</li>
<li>moral hazard: more competitive the market, firms and managers work harder to survive</li>
<li>selection: with market power, inefficient firm can survive; cannot happen in a competitive market</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Aghion et. al (QJE, 2005) find that more competition leads to more innovation</li>
<li>Michael Porter (1990): competition is necessary to stimulate firms to innovate</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="not-always-bad" class="slide level2">
<h1>not always bad</h1>
<ul>
<li>patents give firms incentives to innovate
<ul>
<li>ex post we lose welfare but we gain ex ante through the introduction of products</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Government can regulate a monopolist: ACM (formerly, OPTA) regulates KPN</li>
<li>Coase: durable good monopolist competes with itself
<ul>
<li>if monopolist cannot commit, reduce prices over time</li>
<li><span class="math">\(p=mc\)</span> with monopoly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>contestable market: firm may be only seller but <span class="math">\(p&lt;p^m\)</span>
<ul>
<li>potential entrants discipline the firm</li>
<li>barrier to entry is formed by sunk entry cost (not fixed cost)</li>
<li>taxi market: entry cost is not the price of a mercedes; can be resold</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="too-competitive" class="slide level2">
<h1>Too competitive?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Mankiw and Whinston (RAND, 1986): two externalities market entry
<ul>
<li><em>business stealing effect</em>: excess entry</li>
<li><em>appropriability effect</em>: too few firms enter</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="create-power" class="slide level2">
<h1>create power</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Outperform other firms</em>:
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(n \geq 2\)</span> firms compete in prices, <span class="math">\(i\)</span>'s cost function: <span class="math">\(C(q_i) = c_i q_i\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(c_1 \leq c_2 \leq ... \leq c_n\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(c_1 &lt; c_2\)</span> implies 1 is monopolist, <span class="math">\(p_1 = c_2\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>switching costs</em>: offer frequent flyer miles or coupons for loyal customers
<ul>
<li>if customer gathered enough miles, optimal to keep on using this airline</li>
<li>though consumers love loyalty schemes, they create market power and lead to higher prices</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>network effects</em>: network effects keep incumbents in the market when there are superior (potential) entrants</li>
<li><em>exclude rivals</em>:
<ul>
<li>incumbent beer brewer sells to pubs and restaurants if they only sell incumbent's beer brands</li>
<li>raises entry cost for newcomers</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="network-effects" class="slide level2">
<h1>network effects</h1>
<ul>
<li>consumers value both intrinsic quality of product and how many other people use it
<ul>
<li>this is different from consuming ice-cream</li>
<li>when you decide on your operating system (Linux, Mac, Windows); relevant how many of your friends use the same os</li>
<li>utility good <span class="math">\(i\)</span>: <span class="math">\(u_i = v_i + \nu(n_i) - p_i\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(1\)</span> is incumbent product with <span class="math">\(n_1 &gt;0\)</span></li>
<li>new product 2 with <span class="math">\(v_2 &gt; v_1\)</span> but nobody uses it yet</li>
<li>even with <span class="math">\(p_2 = c_2 &lt; p_1\)</span> can be that <span class="math">\(v_1 + \nu(n_1) - p_1 &gt;   v_2 + \nu(0) - p_2\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>network effect gives incumbent market power</li>
<li>example VHS vs Betamax standard in videos
<ul>
<li>small differences at the start lead to completely different outcomes</li>

<section><section id="defining-markets" class="titleslide slide level1"><h1>defining markets</h1></section><section id="relevant-market" class="slide level2">
<h1>relevant market</h1>
<ul>
<li>not much damage can be done by firms that are small players
<ul>
<li>if two firms with each a market share of 1 percent want to merge, no reason to block such a merger</li>
<li>but when Microsoft or Google act suspiciously, we do worry</li>
</ul></li>
<li>market share is important in competition policy cases</li>
<li>market share <span class="math">\(=\)</span> firm's revenue divided by total market revenue</li>
<li>but what is the total market?
<ul>
<li>if you sell apples, is the relevant market apples or fruit?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>economists do not tend to worry about relevant market
<ul>
<li>find out directly whether a merger leads to higher prices; whether a practice is welfare reducing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>European Courts do require a definition of the relevant market</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="procedure" class="slide level2">
<h1>procedure</h1>
<ul>
<li>guiding principle: &quot;a relevant market is worth monopolizing&quot;</li>
<li>relevant market is a collection of products and regions such that a (hypothetical) monopolist would be able to increase prices profitably (but from which benchmark?)
<ul>
<li>contains all substitute products and regions which provide competitive constraint on the products and regions under consideration</li>
</ul></li>
<li>you wonder whether bananas in the Netherlands form a relevant market:
<ul>
<li>ask: if there would be a (hypothetical) monopolist on the Dutch banana market, would she be able to <em>profitably</em> raise prices by 5 to 10 percent (<em>ceteris paribus</em>: assuming all other prices remain constant)?</li>
<li>if so, bananas in the Netherlands is a relevant market (perhaps bananas in Brabant is already a relevant market)</li>
<li>if not, expand the market and see whether on this expanded market a hypothetical monopolist would be able to profitable raise prices</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="substitution" class="slide level2">
<h1>substitution</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>demand side substitution</em>: if consumers would switch from bananas to kiwis after the price increase, the question becomes whether bananas and kiwis together form a relevant market</li>
<li><em>supply side substitution</em>: if suppliers of banana liquor would start to sell bananas after the price increase, question becomes whether the combined market of bananas and banana liquor form a relevant market</li>
<li><em>geographic market</em>: if consumers would start to buy bananas in Belgium after the price increase, the question becomes whether bananas in the Netherlands and Belgium form a relevant market</li>
<li>question is: is the market under consideration worth monopolizing?</li>
<li>relevant market is smallest set of products worth monopolizing</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="ssnip-test" class="slide level2">
<h1>SSNIP test</h1>
<ul>
<li>this is known as SSNIP test: small but significant non-transitory increase in prices
<ul>
<li>''small but significant'' is often taken to mean 5-10%</li>
<li>&quot;non-transitory&quot;: if this could be profitably done for 5 days only, the market is not worth monopolizing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>in economic terms, relevant question concerns elasticities
<ul>
<li>if price of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is increased by 10%, by which percentage does demand fall? e.g. because consumers buy outside the region</li>
<li>if drop in demand is big, price rise is not profitable; market for <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is not worth monopolizing</li>
<li>or by which percentage does supply increase?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="fallacies" class="slide level2">
<h1>fallacies</h1>
<ul>
<li>applying SSNIP test can lead to two ''famous mistakes'':
<ul>
<li><em>toothless fallacy</em>: marginal vs average consumer</li>
<li><em>cellophane fallacy</em>: starting point for price increase</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="toothless-fallacy" class="slide level2">
<h1>toothless fallacy</h1>
<ul>
<li>Commission in United Brands case: defining relevant market on the basis of the average consumer</li>
<li>Commission argued that very young and very old (those without teeth) did not consider other fruit a substitute for bananas</li>
<li>Commission concluded that bananas is a relevant market</li>
<li>however, when a (hypothetical) monopolist raises its price, question is not whether average consumer moves away, but whether marginal consumer substitutes away</li>
<li>if enough consumers <em>at the margin</em> substitute away, price increase is not profitable (although a number of consumer may be captive)</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="other-examples" class="slide level2">
<h1>other examples</h1>
<ul>
<li>some people do not like sparkling water; for them still and sparkling water are not substitutes
<ul>
<li>yet, still and sparkling water are on same relevant market if enough consumers (at the margin) switch from still to sparkling if the price of still water is increased by 10%</li>
</ul></li>
<li>aftermarkets: cheap ink-jet printer of brand <span class="math">\(X\)</span> but cartridges are sold by <span class="math">\(X\)</span> at a high price
<ul>
<li>do cartridges of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> form a relevant market</li>
<li>probably not: although you will be stuck if <span class="math">\(X\)</span> increases price, buyers of new printers substitute away from <span class="math">\(X\)</span> because its cartridges are so expensive</li>
<li>buyers of new printers are the marginal consumers</li>
<li>if enough marginal consumers switch away from <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, rise in cartridge prices is not profitable</li>
<li>if so, market for <span class="math">\(X\)</span> cartridges is not a relevant market</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="other-examples-1" class="slide level2">
<h1>other examples</h1>
<ul>
<li>are Rolex and Casio watches in the same market?
<ul>
<li>some people argue they are not because they sell at completely different prices and are of completely different quality</li>
<li>correct question: do consumers at the margin switch from Rolex to Casio if price of Rolex watches is increased by 10%</li>
<li>CES utility function <span class="math">\(u(x,y)=(a x^\theta + b   y^\theta)^{1/\theta}\)</span></li>
<li>whether goods are substitutes is determined by <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span></li>
<li>if <span class="math">\(a &gt;&gt; b\)</span> then price of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> will be higher than price of <span class="math">\(Y\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="cellophane-fallacy" class="slide level2">
<h1>cellophane fallacy</h1>
<ul>
<li>SSNIP test considers price increase of 5-10%, but from which benchmark?</li>
<li>depends on the question that you want to answer</li>
<li>benchmark price differs between merger cases and Article 101, 102 cases</li>
<li>definition of relevant market is different for different questions</li>
<li>merger case: whether the merger between two firms leads to price increase
<ul>
<li>question is whether at current prices merged firm has enough market power to raise prices</li>
<li>benchmark price is current price on the market</li>
</ul></li>
<li>abuse of a dominant position case: current price not necessarily the right benchmark</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="cellophane-case" class="slide level2">
<h1>cellophane case</h1>
<ul>
<li>US case: Du Pont argued that cellophane was not a separate relevant market
<ul>
<li>empirical evidence showed that it competed closely with other packaging materials such as aluminium foil and wax paper</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Du Pont sole supplier of cellophane</li>
<li>on the wider market of packaging materials it had a smaller market share</li>
<li>US Supreme Court agreed that because of these other packaging materials Du Pont could not increase prices further</li>
<li>from this it does not follow that Du Pont did not have market power
<ul>
<li>as a monopolist Du Pont had increased the price of cellophane to such an extent that other (inferior) packaging materials now became substitutes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>observation that Du Pont's cellophane did compete with these other materials strongly suggests that Du Pont did abuse its market power by charging excessive prices for cellophane</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="benchmark-price" class="slide level2">
<h1>benchmark price</h1>
<ul>
<li>in abuse case, current price level is not necessarily right benchmark for SSNIP test</li>
<li>sometimes take competitive price (or the price prevailing under effective or workable competition) as a benchmark</li>
<li>Du Pont as monopolist was able to raise price of cellophane profitably by 10% from the competitive price</li>
<li>if you try to determine whether a firm has abused her market power by raising prices, relevant market should be determined with competitive prices as benchmark (not current prices)</li>
<li>recall that a profit maximizing monopolist cannot profitably increase her price by 10% at current prices</li>
</ul>
</section></section>
<section><section id="concentration-and-market-power" class="titleslide slide level1"><h1>concentration and market power</h1></section><section id="market-share" class="slide level2">
<h1>market share</h1>
<ul>
<li>tendency among lawyers to interpret high market share as a signal of market power</li>
<li>not necessarily correct:
<ul>
<li>two firms <span class="math">\(1,2\)</span> producing a homogenous good</li>
<li><span class="math">\(p = 1- (q_1+q_2)\)</span></li>
<li>firm's marginal costs: <span class="math">\(c_1=0,c_2=c&lt; 0.5\)</span></li>
<li>Cournot competition implies (<em>check</em>) <span class="math">\(q_1^C =   \frac{1+c}{3},q_2^C = \frac{1-2c}{3},p^C=\frac{1+c}{3}\)</span></li>
<li>Bertrand competition: <span class="math">\(q_1^B=1-c,q_2^B=0,p^B=c\)</span></li>
<li>Bertrand outcome is more competitive than Cournot</li>
<li>Bertrand market is more concentrated than Cournot market</li>
<li>lack of competition under Cournot allows less efficient firm 2 to enter</li>
<li>high concentration can be sign of intense competition</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
