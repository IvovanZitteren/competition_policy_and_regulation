<li>Why do we care about the relation between competition and innovation?<ul>
<li>We know that competition improves static efficiency (reduces the
deadweight loss)</li>
<li>However, if more intense competition would reduce innovation, this
loss is probably bigger than the gain in consumer surplus</li>
<li>Better to have a product that is expensive than one that has not
been invented at all</li>
<li>On the other hand, if more intense competition stimulates
innovation, then competition improves both static and dynamic
efficiency</li>
<li>Then the arguments to liberalize and deregulate sectors become
stronger.</li>
<li>When a competition authority calculates the value it creates for
society, it should not only focus on lower prices for consumers
but also take into account that competition leads to more, better
and cheaper products.</li>
<li>Further, if a merger is expected to increase market power, it will
not only raise prices but also reduce innovation. Gives even
stronger arguments to abolish the merger.</li>

<h3>Incentives<a class="headerlink" href="#incentives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ex ante vs Ex post competition<ul>
<li>An intuition that is often mentioned is that under perfect
competition there cannot be innovation: with each firm pricing at
marginal costs, profits are zero and hence there is no incentive
to innovate.</li>
<li>This intuition is incorrect as it confuses ex ante and ex post
competition.</li>
<li>Obviously, if you invent a cheaper way to produce products, the
(intellectual) property right should be protected (e.g. through a
patent or through secrecy)</li>
<li>Hence, ex post your competitors should not have free access to
your innovation; this will create market power for the inventor ex
post</li>
<li>However, the first question we are interested in is: how does ex
ante competition affect the incentives to innovate?</li>
<li>We will look at a number of &#8220;stories&#8221; here:<ul>
<li>competition enhances the incentive to innovate directly</li>
<li>competition enhances the incentive to innovate by disciplining
firms&#8217; managers</li>
<li>competition raises the incentives to innovate, but reduces it
for very high &#8220;levels of competition&#8221; (inverse U)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Competition raises innovation<ul>
<li>Consider a market with linear demand \(x=1-p\) where the current
state of the art technology produces the product with constant
marginal costs \(c &gt; 0\).</li>
<li>Assume a new technology can be invented that reduces marginal
costs to \(c&#8217; =0\)</li>
<li>If there is a monopoly in the sector, she will maximize profits
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Mon} (p-c)(1-p) \end{equation}</li>
<li><em>TODO</em> the monopolist chooses \(p=\textstyle{1\over 2} (1+c)\)
and profit equals \(\pi^m = \textstyle{1\over 4}
(1-c)^2\). <strong>check</strong></li>
<li>The incentive for the monopolist to innovate is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:IncMon} \Delta^m =
\textstyle{1\over 4} - \textstyle{1\over 4}(1-c)^2
\end{equation}</li>
<li>Now assume that we have at least two firms who play a Bertrand
game.</li>
<li>Before the innovation, \(p^B = c\) and all firms have zero
profits.</li>
<li>If one firm gets the patent on the innovation, his profits equal
(assuming \(c &lt; \textstyle{1\over 2}\)) \(\pi^B = c(1-c)\)</li>
<li>Hence the incentive to innovate equals
\begin{equation} \label{eq:IncBertr} \Delta^B = c(1-c)
\end{equation}</li>
<li><em>TODO</em> which exceeds \(\Delta^m\) <strong>check</strong></li>
<li>intuition: competition forces the firm to produce more and hence
the reduction in marginal costs (\(c&#8217;-c\)) yields a gain over a
higher output level</li>
<li>If \(c \geq \textstyle{1\over 2}\), the price after the
innovation does not equal \(c\) but equals the monopoly price
\(\textstyle{1\over 2}\) (innovation is drastic)</li>
<li>In that case, \(\pi^B = \pi^m\) after the innovation. But
before innovating, the Bertrand profit equals 0 while monopoly
profit is strict positive</li>
<li>This is called the Arrow replacement effect: a monopolist replaces
herself and therefore has less incentive to innovate.</li>
<li>If competition is intensified through entry by firms under, say,
Cournot competition, each firm&#8217;s output level goes down (also
after innovation) and hence such an increase in competition may
reduce the incentive to innovate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>competition disciplines managers Aghion et al. (1999)<ul>
<li>Above we assumed that firms were run by their owners and hence
maximized profits</li>
<li>many firms are run by managers who do not own all equity</li>
<li>These managers do not necessarily maximize profits</li>
<li>Assume that such managers want to minimize effort and that
adopting and implementing innovations requires managers&#8217; efforts</li>
<li>Then managers will tend to reduce their effort as much as
possible, unless they are about to go bankrupt (in which case they
lose their salary and other on-the-job perks)</li>
<li>By intensifying competition, firms&#8217; profits are reduced and hence
the threat of bankruptcy comes more quickly</li>
<li>After the increase in competition managers are forced to innovate
more to avoid bankruptcy</li>
<li>Hence the effect here is: more competition reduces profits and
thereby raises innovation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inverted U<ul>
<li>Aghion et al. (2005) show empirically that there may be both a
positive and negative effect of competition on innovation</li>
<li>They consider the following duopoly model</li>
<li>There are two firms in an industry that compete over time in both
production and innovation</li>
<li>The two firms may have the same technology (say, same cost level);
in that case they are ``level&#8217;&#8216;</li>
<li>If one of these firms innovates, he gets one step ahead (\(+1\))
of the other firm who then lags one step behind (\(-1\))</li>
<li>By assumption, firms cannot be more than one step apart</li>
<li>A firm that is one step ahead (behind) makes profits \(\pi_{+1}
(\pi_{-1})\). These profits are given.</li>
<li>Level firms make a profit equal to \(\pi_0 \in
[0,\textstyle{1\over 2} \pi^m_0]\), the higher this profit
is, the less competitive the industry</li>
<li>If \(\pi_0 = \textstyle{1\over 2} \pi^m\) each firm makes
half the monopoly profit due to a cartel; with \(\pi_0 =0\) we
have Bertrand competition.</li>
<li>What are the incentives to innovate?<ul>
<li>If both firms are level, as a first approx. the gain to
innovating equals \(\Delta_0 = \pi_{+1} - \pi_0\)
because if a firm innovates, it moves one step ahead and makes
profits equal to \(\pi_{+1}\) instead of \(\pi_0\)</li>
<li>Similarly, when the firm lags behind, the incentive to catch up
equals \(\Delta_{-1} = \pi_0 - \pi_{-1}\)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modelling an increase in competition as a fall in \(\pi_0\),
we find that such an increase in competition raises
\(\Delta_0\) while it reduces \(\Delta_{-1}\)</li>
<li>In other words, more intense competition increases the incentive
to innovate to escape the competition but it reduces the incentive
to catch up</li>
<li>When competition is weak, the sector is level most of the time (as
there is hardly an incentive to escape the competition), hence an
increase in competition in this case will raise innovation (on
average) in this industry</li>
<li>As competition keeps on increasing, the sector is (on average)
more often unlevel (as the escape the competition effect is
increased while the catch up effect is reduced)</li>
<li>Hence for high enough competition intensity, the sector is almost
always unlevel and a further increase in competition reduces
innovation (on average) as the reduction in the catch up effect
dominates the escape the competition effect</li>
<li>In this case, one finds an inverse U relation between competition
and innovation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Schumpeterian argument<ul>
<li>Sometimes, people claim that Schumpeter&#8217;s argument for market
power to stimulate innovation should be interpreted as pointing to
capital market imperfections</li>
<li>The idea is then that R&amp;D is intangible capital (you cannot take a
mortgage on R&amp;D investment as you can on an office building)</li>
<li>Hence it is hard for the capital market to finance R&amp;D</li>
<li>Therefore R&amp;D needs to be financed out of retained earnings</li>
<li>The more (ex ante) market power a firm has, the higher its profits
and thus the more R&amp;D it can finance itself</li>
<li>Due to the capital market imperfection, a reduction in competition
intensity increases innovation</li>
<li>In principle this may be true, however, it is not obvious</li>
<li>The capital market imperfection stems from the problem that debt
and equity holders cannot monitor the way the money is spent (e.g.
whether it is really spent on R&amp;D or whether a manager is giving
presents to friends and family)</li>
<li>As capital providers cannot be sure that the money is well spent,
they do not lend money to the firm</li>
<li>Given these problems, how can we be sure that the higher profits
(due to reduced competition) will be spent efficiently on R&amp;D?</li>

<h3>Antitrust and innovation<a class="headerlink" href="#antitrust-and-innovation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>models above consider the effect of competition, not directly

<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.stanford.edu/~isegal/at_innovation.pdf">Segal and Whinston (2007)</a> model
antitrust policy in a more concrete way</li>
<li>question is whether competition policy should be different in
innovative industries</li>
<li>in competition policy lectures we have considered attempts by
incumbents to exclude entrants</li>
<li>we derived conditions under which such behaviour is profitable for
incumbents but bad for welfare</li>
<li>one way to introduce innovation into this story is to assume that an
entrant can innovate to enter the industry</li>
<li>if the incumbent uses exclusionary practices, entry becomes harder</li>
<li>antitrust policy reducing such practices stimulates entry (direct
effect) and hence innovation</li>
<li>but with this antitrust policy, the entrant knows that she cannot use
exclusionary practices once she has entered successfully</li>
<li>this indirect effect reduces the incentives to innovate by the
entrant</li>
<li>Segal and Whinston analyze the overall effect of policies aimed at
reducing exclusionary practices</li>
<li>model<ul>
<li>duopoly model, incumbent \(I\) and (potential) entrant \(E\)</li>
<li>only entrant can invest \(c(\phi)\) to innovate with
probability \(\phi\); \(c,c&#8217;,c^{\prime\prime} &gt;0\)</li>
<li>if entrant innovates, she receives patent on product which is
\(\Delta &gt; 0\) better than incumbent&#8217;s product</li>
<li>if entrant does not innovate, incumbent has profits
\(\pi_{m}\)</li>
<li>if entrant innovates and enters, in the period of entry profits
are given by \(\pi_{I},\pi_{E}\)</li>
<li>then incumbent leaves the market and becomes potential entrant
next period</li>
<li>discount factor \(\delta \in \langle 0,1 \rangle\)</li>
<li>Bellman equations take the following form
\begin{eqnarray} V_{I} &amp;=&amp; \pi_{m}+\delta V_{I} + \phi
[\pi_{I} -\pi_{m} + \delta(V_{E}-V_{I})] \\ V_{E} &amp;=&amp;
-c(\phi) + \delta V_{E} + \phi[\pi_{E} +
\delta(V_{I}-V_{E})] \end{eqnarray}</li>
<li>first order condition: \(c&#8217;(\phi) = \pi_{E} +
\delta(V_{I}-V_{E})\)</li>
<li><em>TODO</em> solve the two Bellman equations to find <strong>check</strong>
\begin{equation} c&#8217;(\phi) =
\frac{[1-\delta(1-\phi)]\pi_{E}+\delta[\phi\pi_{I}+(1-\phi)\pi_{m}+c(\phi)]}{1-\delta+2
\delta\phi} \end{equation}</li>
<li>\(c^{\prime\prime}&gt;0\) implies that left hand side is increasing in
\(\phi\)</li>
<li>assume that right hand side is decreasing in \(\phi\)</li>
<li>if competition policy can increase the right hand side, it raises
\(\phi\) and hence stimulates innovation</li>
<li>let \(\alpha\) parameterize competition policy with higher
\(\alpha\) denoting more strict competition policy</li>
<li>we can write the three profit levels as a function of
\(\alpha\):
\(\pi_{m}(\alpha),\pi_{E}(\alpha),\pi_{I}(\alpha)\)</li>
<li>then an increase in \(\alpha\) stimulates innovation if
\begin{equation} (A)~\pi&#8217;_{E}(\alpha) + \delta
\frac{(1-\phi)\pi&#8217;_{m}(\alpha)+\phi
\pi&#8217;_{I}(\alpha)}{1-\delta(1-\phi)} &gt; 0 \end{equation}</li>
<li>the first term denotes the direct effect of antitrust policy on
entrant&#8217;s profits</li>
<li>but once the entrant is in the market, next period (discounted by
\(\delta\)) she is the incumbent</li>
<li>discounted profits of being an incumbent equal sum of
\(\pi_{m}\) (before entry; probability \(1-\phi\) each
period) and \(\pi_{I}\) (after entry; probability \(\phi\)
each period)</li>
<li>effective discount rate takes \(\delta\) and probability
\(\phi\) of being replaced by entry into account:
\begin{equation}
1+\delta(1-\phi)+[\delta(1-\phi)]^{2}+[\delta(1-\phi)]^{3}+
\ldots = \frac{1}{1-\delta(1-\phi)} \end{equation}</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>exclusionary practices<ul>
<li>in this model we can model exclusion as follows</li>
<li>for each producer, costs of production equal 0</li>
<li>each producer of leading technology (whether \(I\) or \(E\))
charges price \(p=\Delta\) (just undercuts previous best
technology)</li>
<li>at the end of each period, incumbent can make a fraction \(B\)
of consumers an exclusive offer: buy from incumbent next period at
price \(q\)<ul>
<li>let \(v\) denote the value of the current incumbent&#8217;s product</li>
<li>if consumer does not sign such an exclusive offer:<ul>
<li>with prob. \(1-\phi\) there is no entry and incumbent
charges \(p^{m}=\Delta\): consumer surplus
\(v-\Delta\)</li>
<li>with probability \(\phi\) there is entry, value of new
product: \(v+\Delta\), consumer surplus \(v\)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if consumer signs contract, surplus equals \(v-q\)</li>
<li>\(q\) solves \((1-\phi)(v-\Delta)+\phi v = v-q\) and
hence \(q=(1-\phi)\Delta\)</li>
<li><em>TODO</em> hence we find that <strong>check</strong>
\begin{eqnarray} \pi_{m} &amp;=&amp; (1-B) \Delta + B
(1-\phi)\Delta \\ \pi_{I} &amp;=&amp; B(1-\phi) \Delta \\
\pi_{E} &amp;=&amp; (1-B)\Delta \end{eqnarray}</li>
<li>competition policy limits the possibilities for exclusion: \(B
\leq 1-\alpha\)</li>
<li>the higher \(\alpha\), the less consumers can be captured
with an exclusive contract</li>
<li>since \(I\) wants to reduce the probability of entry
\(\phi\), choose \(B\) as high as possible:
\(B=1-\alpha\)</li>
<li>profits are given by
\begin{eqnarray} \pi_{m} &amp;=&amp; \alpha \Delta + (1-\alpha)
(1-\phi)\Delta \\ \pi_{I} &amp;=&amp; (1-\alpha)(1-\phi)
\Delta \\ \pi_{E} &amp;=&amp; \alpha\Delta \end{eqnarray}</li>
<li>substitute this into equation (A):</li>
<li><em>TODO</em> \(\alpha\) raises \(c&#8217;(\phi)\) (and hence
\(\phi\)) because
\(\pi&#8217;_{E}(\alpha)=\Delta&gt;0\) <strong>check</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><p class="first">question 1 [25 points] Innovation</p>
<p>Consider a market with demand of the form \(p=1-q\). Current
constant marginal costs equals \(c \leq 1/2\).</p>
<p>(a) [2 points] Assume that there is a monopolist in this market. Show
that his output level equals \(q^{m}=(1-c)/2\) and profits equal
\(\pi^m = (1-c)^2/4\).</p>
<p>(b) [3 points] If this monopolist can invest to reduce his production
costs \(c\), show that his incentive to do so is –at the margin–
given by</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:23} \frac{\partial \pi^m}{\partial
c} = - \frac{1-c}{2} \end{equation}</p>
<p>Why is this derivative negative?</p>
<p>(c) [3 points] Now assume that there are two firms in this market
competing in quantities (Cournot). Firm 1 has constant marginal costs
\(c_1 \leq 1/2\) and firm 2 \(c_2 \leq 1/2\). Show that
output levels \(q_1,q_2\) in equilibrium are determined by</p>
<p>\begin{align} \label{eq:24} 1-2q_1-q_2-c_1 &amp;=0 \\
1-2q_2-q_1-c_2 &amp;=0 \end{align}</p>
<p>Solving these equations we find that (you do not need to show this,
we are telling you this):</p>
<p>\begin{align} \label{eq:25} q_i &amp;= (1-2c_i+c_j)/3 \\ \pi_i
&amp;= (1-2c_i+c_j)^2/9 \end{align}</p>
<p>with \(i,j \in \{1,2\}, i \neq j\).</p>
<p>(d) [2 points] Show that firm \(i\)&#8217;s incentive to reduce costs is
–at the margin– given by</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:26} \frac{\partial \pi_i}{\partial
c_i} = - \frac{4}{9} (1-2c_i+c_j) \end{equation}</p>
<p>(e) [5 points] Assume that \(c_1 =c_2=c\). Compare the incentive
to reduce \(c\) for the monopolist with the incentive for a
duopolist. Which firm (i.e. monopolist or duopolist) has the bigger
incentive to reduce \(c\)? Why? Discuss your answer in the light of
the effects of competition on innovation.</p>
<p>Now assume that there is an incumbent firm with constant marginal
costs \(c \leq 1/2\) and fixed costs of production \(f \in
\langle 0,1/16\rangle\). A potential has access to the following
R&amp;D technology. By investing \(\phi^2 /2\), there is a probability
\(\phi\) that the entrant comes into the market with constant
marginal costs equal to \(\hat c =0\) (and no fixed costs of
production).</p>
<p>In response to this, the incumbent offers customers the following
contract to be signed now before it is known whether the entrant
comes into the market. If the entrant does not come into the market,
the customer buys at a price \(p=(1+c)/2\). If the entrant does
enter, customer can buy from the incumbent at a price \(p=\alpha
c\) with \(\alpha \in [0,1]\).</p>
<p>(f) [5 points] Show that the entrant&#8217;s profits in the market (if it
enters) equal \(\pi_e = \alpha c (1- \alpha c)\). Show that
profits \(\pi_e\) increase with \(\alpha\).</p>
<p>(g) [2 points] Suppose that the entrant wants to complain about this
contract at the European Commission. Which article should it refer to
and what is the argument?</p>
<p>(h) [3 points] Which test can be used to argue that the incumbent&#8217;s
contract is problematic in case \(\alpha=1\)? And which other test
in case \(\alpha &lt; 1\)?</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>the question is: should the contract for public good provider
\(P_1\) depend on the performance of \(P_2\) (and the other
way around)?</li>
<li>this is called yardstick competition or relative performance
evaluation</li>
<li>in order to analyze this in the framework above, we assume that

</li>
<li>if we assume that \(\beta^a \equiv 0\), we are back to the

yardstick competition</li>

</li>
<li>if we assume that \(\beta^i \equiv 0\), yardstick competition

<li>if the regulator does not understand the nature of
\(\beta^a\), she may treat each firm independently</li>

\(\beta^h\) is closed down or there are positive rents for
\(\beta^l\) and inefficient low effort for \(\beta^h\)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if the regulator does understand the nature of \(\beta^a\), she
offers \(P_i\) the following contract:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:21} t^i = \psi(e^*) - (C^i - C^j)
\end{equation}</li>
<li>that is, \(P_i\) gets higher transfer if it outperforms
\(P_j\): \(C^i &lt; C^j\): yardstick competition</li>
<li>\(P_i\) solves
\begin{equation} \label{eq:22} \max_e \{\psi(e^*)-
[(\beta^a - e)-(\beta^a - e^j) ] -\psi(e) \} \end{equation}</li>

<li><p class="first">In the interactive lecture we can go over the <em>TODO</em>&#8216;s above which you
cannot figure out yourself</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">question 1: graphical version of this lecture</p>
<p>Whereas the lecture on this topic considered the &#8220;calculus
approach&#8221;, here we focus on the graphical presentation of this
problem. For the exam you need to be able to understand both these
approaches.</p>
<p>We consider the same set-up as in the lecture. There is a public
project with value \(S\) to society. There is one firm, the
monopolist, who can do this project at cost \(C=\beta-e\).
\(\beta \in \{\beta^l,\beta^h\}\) is the type of the firm
with \(\beta^h &gt; \beta^l &gt;0\) and \(e\) denotes the firm&#8217;s
effort to reduce production costs. The cost of effort is denoted by
\(\psi(e)\) with \(\psi,\psi&#8217;,\psi^{\prime\prime}&gt;0\) for \(e&gt;0\).
Planner pays the firm a transfer \(T = t+C\) where \(t\) denotes
the transfer net of costs. Cost for the planner to raise \(T\)
equals \((1+\lambda)T\) with \(\lambda \geq 0\).</p>
<p>Payoff to the firm equals \(u = t - \psi(e)\). If the firm does
not produce, it gets an outside utility equal to 0.</p>
<p>The figure shows indifference curves in \(C,t\)-space: \(u^l=0\)
for the \(\beta^l\) type and \(u^h=0\) for the \(\beta^h\)
type. Further, it shows the first best contracts: \(\alpha\) for
the low type and \(\beta\) for the high type.</p>

<div><p>(a) [5 points] Why is the \(u^h =0\) line steeper than the
\(u^l=0\) line for each \(C\)? Why is \(C\) in contract
\(\alpha\) lower than \(C\) in contract \(\beta\)?</p>
<p>(b) [5 points] Derive the slope of the relevant indifference curve at
contract \(\alpha\) and at \(\beta\)?</p>
<p>From now on we assume that the planner cannot observe

<p>(c) [5 points] Use the figure to argue that the contracts
\(\alpha,\beta\) cannot be implemented in case of asymmetric

<p>(d) [5 points] Suppose that the planner wants to implement first best
effort levels. Redraw the figure with two contracts that feature (i)
first best effort for each type and (ii) incentive compatibility
(with lowest possible rents). Draw for each type the indifference

outcome under (d) optimal for the planner? What is the problem if
\(\lambda\) is higher than this value?</p>
<p>From now on, we assume that \(\lambda\) is too high to make it
optimal for the planner to implement the first best effort levels for

<h3>Should we allow an insurer to merge with a provider?<a class="headerlink" href="#should-we-allow-an-insurer-to-merge-with-a-provider" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Introduction</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In the Netherlands there is a debate whether an insurer should be
allowed to take over a provider, like a hospital</li>
<li>Some people think this is highly problematic and should therefore
be forbidden</li>
<li>Others believe such integration of insurers and providers is a
good thing as coordination is easier within a firm than between
firms</li>
<li>Some go even further: why not integrate insurer, hospital, primary
physician, physiotherapist etc.</li>
<li>Then there is coordination not only between insurer and provider
but also between different providers</li>
<li>We will consider the pros and cons of integration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Why integration should be abolished</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If an insurer integrates with a provider, this provider is no
longer available for patients at other insurers (foreclosure)</li>
<li>or the provider is available for other insurers at a higher
price/lower quality (partial foreclosure)</li>
<li>This is problematic for people living close to a hospital who have
another insurer</li>
<li>Integration increases market power of insurers and leads to higher
prices for health insurance</li>
<li>Integration makes it harder for other providers or insurers to
enter the market</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Why integration is a good thing</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Integration makes health care cheaper: without integration, a
provider sells treatments to the insurer at prices above costs
(otherwise it cannot cover its fixed costs) and the insurer sells
to consumers at prices above the (expected) treatment prices
(otherwise insurer cannot cover fixed costs): double
marginalization</li>
<li>After integration the insurer has a bigger incentive to invest in
the hospital<ul>
<li>free riding is reduced: when an insurer invests in a provider,
other insurers do not benefit</li>
<li>hold up is reduced: after integration, insurer investing in a
hospital does not need to worry that hospital gets (some of)
the rents</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Why these arguments are &#8220;inaccurate&#8221;</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Why does integration lead to more market power and foreclosure?</li>
<li>Double marginalization can also be solved using two part tariffs;
why do we need integration to solve this?</li>
<li>Why can&#8217;t contracts protect specific investments?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Vertical integration and other restraints</p>
<ul>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line">Intra-brand competition</div>
</div>
<p>The models discussed on <a class="reference internal" href="Article101and102LectureNotes.html#intra"><span>intra-brand competition</span></a> can be
applied here as well: provider is upstream firm and insurer is
downstream.</p>
<p>Then analysis in competition policy lecture (on double
marginalization, foreclosure etc.) applies here as well.</p>
<p>So here we focus on the investment incentives</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Investments</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Two arguments why integration may help to stimulate investments</li>
<li>hold up: suppose insurer can invest \(x\) to increase value
\(V(x)\) of his cooperation with provider \(P\) (say, to
reduce cost \(c\)) with \(V&#8217; &gt;0, V^{\prime\prime} &lt;0\)</li>
<li>After the investment, \(I\) and \(P\) bargain about the
distribution of the value \(V(x)\); part \(\beta &lt; 1\) goes
to \(I\) and \((1-\beta)\) to \(P\) (e.g. \(\beta =
0.5\))</li>
<li>Then \(I\) chooses \(x\) to solve \(\max_x \beta V(x) -
x\)</li>
<li>First order condition: \(\beta V&#8217;(x) =1\)</li>
<li>\(I\) underinvests in \(x\) because he has to share the
returns with \(P\)</li>
<li>Put differently, there is positive external effect from \(I\)&#8217;s
investment on \(P\) that leads to underinvestment</li>
<li>After integration, \(I\) and \(P\) solve \(\max_x V(x) -
x\), hence investments go up after integration because all
effects are internalized by \(I\) and \(P\)</li>
<li>free riding: Suppose \(I_1\) can invest in \(P\) to raise its
demand \(p(q,x)\) with \(p_x &gt;0\) (or reduce costs
\(\gamma(x)\) with \(\gamma_x &lt;0\)).</li>
<li>Think of software to guide patients through a decision process of
what type of treatment they want</li>
<li>However, \(P\) can also use this software for patients from
\(I_2\)</li>
<li>Such free riding by \(I_2\) on \(I_1\)&#8217;s investment reduces
\(I_1\)&#8217;s incentive to invest:<ul>
<li>low costs \(\gamma\) are especially profitable, if you are
the only one with such low costs</li>
<li>service \(x\) is especially attractive for customers
(\(p_x\) is high) if \(I_1\) is the only one offering
this service</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integration helps to remove free riding. The combination \(P\)
and \(I_1\) will not let customers from \(I_2\) use this
investment (or \(I_2\)&#8217;s customers can benefit from investment
\(x\) through higher price)</li>
<li>Hence integration stimulates investment also in the case of free
riding.</li>
<li>Assumptions needed to make sense of this:<ul>
<li>\(P\) cannot invest itself (e.g. cash constraint)</li>
<li>\(I_1\) cannot write a contract to appropriate the returns
from the investment (e.g. to exclude \(I_2\) from using the
investment)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Policy implications</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is not obvious that vertical integration between insurer and
provider is bad for welfare (Chicago school arguments)</li>
<li>It can reduce prices in case of double marginalization (but two
part tariffs can do the same)</li>
<li>However, if providers cannot commit to contracts, they cannot
generate monopoly profits and prices will be lower (Hart and
Tirole)</li>
<li>In that case vertical integration can help to raise prices</li>
<li>Other insurers are (partially) foreclosed</li>
<li>Integration may help to stimulate investments (in case of hold up
and free riding)</li>

adjustment (based on an insurer&#8217;s realized costs)</li>
<li>From a regulation point of view, this is a bit worrying</li>

<ul>
<li><p class="first">question 1 [30 points] Health care</p>
<p>Consider the situation of one provider \(P\) and one insurer
\(I\). The insurer faces a demand for health insurance of the form
\(q= 1-\sigma\) where \(\sigma&gt;0\) denotes the premium for the
insurance contract. For simplicity, there is no copayment nor
deductible if an insured needs treatment. The probability that an
insured needs treatment is given by \(\theta \in \langle 0,1
\rangle\). A patient can only be treated by \(P\) is she is
insured.</p>
<p>The provider charges a price \(w\) for each insured that is treated
by \(P\). The cost of treatment for the provider equals \(c\).</p>
<p>(a) [5 points] Show that –given \(w\)– the profit maximizing
premium is given by \(\sigma = (1+\theta w)/2\) and the number of
people buying insurance is given by \(q = (1-\theta w)/2\).</p>
<p>(b) [5 points] Show that the provider chooses \(w\) to solve
\begin{equation} \label{eq:27} \max_w \theta\frac{1-\theta
w}{2}(w-c) \end{equation}
Show that \(P\) sets \(w = (1/\theta + c)/2\) and hence
\(\sigma = (3+\theta c)/4\).</p>
<p>(c) [5 points] The insurer and provider want to vertically integrate.
What will be the insurance premium \(\sigma\) after integration?
How does this compare to the answer under (b)? What is the intuition
for this comparison?</p>
<p>(d) [5 points] The insurer and provider argue that their vertical
merger increases welfare. Is this true? If so, is this a sound
argument for integration?</p>
<p>Now assume a new provider \(P_e\) wants to enter the market. This
entrant has treatment costs \(c_e &lt; c\). \(P\) gives \(I\) a
contract that specifies that \(I\) contracts only with \(P\) next
period. If \(I\) decides to send some insured patients to
\(P_e\), it has to pay \(P\) a penalty \(d&gt;0\).</p>
<p>(e) [2 points] If \(P_e\) wants to go to the European commission
to complain about \(P\)&#8217;s contract, which article of the treaty is

<p>(f) [3 points] Give the Chicago school argument why \(P\)&#8217;s
contract is not welfare reducing.</p>
<p>(g) [5 points] Sketch a model (no need to solve the model) which
