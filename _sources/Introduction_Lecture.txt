Introduction to course
======================

This lecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~


- two parts


    -  first, how the course is organized
    -  then introduction to competition policy
    -  recommended reading: Massimo Motta, 2004, *Competition Policy:
       theory and practice*, Cambridge University Press.

expectations
------------

-  we expect you to prepare each lecture
-  watch video lecture beforehand
-  prepare exercises to be discussed in class
-  follow the datacamp lectures on python
-  for next lecture: install python

   - look `here <http://janboone.github.io/competition_policy_and_regulation/Introduction_to_Python/Introduction_to_Python.html>`_ to see how this should be done

grade
-----

-  your grade is the average of

   -  2 assignments
   -  1 exam
   -  class participation

-  each has the same weight (25%)
-  assignments are mandatory and involve programming in python
-  class participation is mandatory and involves exercises from previous exams
-  grades for assignments and class participation can only be used this academic year

assignments
-----------

-  assignments can be done alone or in a team of 2 students
-  for the programming assignments, you will do simulations
-  next lecture will be an introduction to python 
-  during the other lectures, I will also show you how to program in python
-  attend (on the web) the datacamp courses on python
-  I know this is new for (most of) you
-  with python we can bring the theory to life
-  as python is new, you are allowed to help each other a bit with this
-  however, assignments are made independently by each team

   
python
------

-  good idea to look into python in the following weeks
-  when you get stuck, you can google
-  but some basic knowledge saves you a lot of time!
-  with python notebooks you can program and explain what you do in the same file
-  learn a bit of markdown and latex

details
-------

-  `Rules of the game <http://janboone.github.io/competition_policy_and_regulation/RulesOfTheGame.html>`_ gives further details and an outline
   of the lectures

Competition law
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EU law
------

-  EU law is structured as follows:

   -  **Article 101**: agreements between firms

      -  *horizontal agreements*: cartels, collusion, joint ventures
      -  *vertical agreements*: manufacturer and wholesaler or
         wholesaler and retailer

   -  **Article 102**: abuse of a dominant position

      -  price discrimination, predatory behavior, tying and bundling,
         refusal to supply

   -  **Merger Regulation**: when one firm plans to acquire another
      firm, the Commission has to be notified

why needed?
-----------

-  economists tend to believe that markets work well
-  welfare theorems: Pareto efficient allocations
-  why do we need a competition authority (CA)?

imperfections
-------------

-  welfare theorems assume firms are price takers
-  in real world firms have (market) power to set prices
-  first year micro: monopolist setting prices leads to deadweight loss
-  under total welfare standard: welfare loss equals deadweight loss
   (:math:`DWL`)
-  under consumer welfare standard: loss equals :math:`DWL+PS`
-  CA tries to prevent monopolies from emerging through mergers
-  when firm is dominant, CA tries to prevent firm from abusing this
   position

objective CA
------------

-  EU and US tend to put more emphasis on CS than on PS

   -  firms can fight for themselves
   -  harder to organize consumers because of free riding problems
   -  against: consumers are also shareholders

-  EU every now and again states as a goal promotion of market integration

   -  political objective; hard to formalize in economics
   -  EU forbids price discrimination across national borders
   -  but from economic point of view can be welfare enhancing

market power
~~~~~~~~~~~~

efficiency
----------

-  Nickell (JPE, 1996): firms with market power are less efficient

   -  with market power, less reason to "worry"
   -  moral hazard: more competitive the market, firms and managers work
      harder to survive
   -  selection: with market power, inefficient firm can survive; cannot
      happen in a competitive market

-  Aghion et. al (QJE, 2005) find that more competition leads to more
   innovation
-  Michael Porter (1990): competition is necessary to stimulate firms to
   innovate

not always bad
--------------

-  patents give firms incentives to innovate

   -  ex post we lose welfare but we gain ex ante through the
      introduction of products

-  Government can regulate a monopolist: ACM (formerly, OPTA) regulates KPN
-  Coase: durable good monopolist competes with itself

   -  if monopolist cannot commit, reduce prices over time
   -  :math:`p=mc` with monopoly

-  contestable market: firm may be only seller but :math:`p<p^m`

   -  potential entrants discipline the firm
   -  barrier to entry is formed by sunk entry cost (not fixed cost)
   -  taxi market: entry cost is not the price of a mercedes; can be
      resold

Too competitive?
----------------

-  Mankiw and Whinston (RAND, 1986): two externalities market entry

   -  *business stealing effect*: excess entry
   -  *appropriability effect*: too few firms enter

create power
------------

-  *Outperform other firms*:

   -  :math:`n \geq 2` firms compete in prices, :math:`i`'s cost
      function: :math:`C(q_i) = c_i q_i`
   -  :math:`c_1 \leq c_2 \leq ... \leq c_n`
   -  :math:`c_1 < c_2` implies 1 is monopolist, :math:`p_1 = c_2`

-  *switching costs*: offer frequent flyer miles or coupons for loyal
   customers

   -  if customer gathered enough miles, optimal to keep on using this
      airline
   -  though consumers love loyalty schemes, they create market power
      and lead to higher prices

-  *network effects*: network effects keep incumbents in the market when
   there are superior (potential) entrants
-  *exclude rivals*:

   -  incumbent beer brewer sells to pubs and restaurants if they only
      sell incumbent's beer brands
   -  raises entry cost for newcomers

network effects
---------------

-  consumers value both intrinsic quality of product and how many other
   people use it

   -  this is different from consuming ice-cream
   -  when you decide on your operating system (Linux, Mac, Windows);
      relevant how many of your friends use the same os
   -  utility good :math:`i`: :math:`u_i = v_i + \nu(n_i) - p_i`
   -  :math:`1` is incumbent product with :math:`n_1 >0`
   -  new product 2 with :math:`v_2 > v_1` but nobody uses it yet
   -  even with :math:`p_2 = c_2 < p_1` can be that
      :math:`v_1 + \nu(n_1) - p_1 >   v_2 + \nu(0) - p_2`

-  network effect gives incumbent market power

   -  small differences at the start lead to completely different
      outcomes

defining markets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

relevant market
---------------

-  not much damage can be done by firms that are small players

   -  if two firms with each a market share of 1 percent want to merge,
      no reason to block such a merger
   -  but when Microsoft or Google act suspiciously, we do worry

-  market share is important in competition policy cases
-  market share :math:`=` firm's revenue divided by total market revenue
-  but what is the total market?

   -  if you sell apples, is the relevant market apples or fruit?

-  economists do not tend to worry about relevant market

   -  find out directly whether a merger leads to higher prices; whether
      a practice is welfare reducing

-  European Courts do require a definition of the relevant market

procedure
---------

-  guiding principle: "a relevant market is worth monopolizing"
-  relevant market is a collection of products and regions such that a
   (hypothetical) monopolist would be able to increase prices profitably
   (but from which benchmark?)

   -  contains all substitute products and regions which provide
      competitive constraint on the products and regions under
      consideration

-  you wonder whether bananas in the Netherlands form a relevant market:

   -  ask: if there would be a (hypothetical) monopolist on the Dutch
      banana market, would she be able to *profitably* raise prices by 5
      to 10 percent (*ceteris paribus*: assuming all other prices remain
      constant)?
   -  if so, bananas in the Netherlands is a relevant market (perhaps
      bananas in Brabant is already a relevant market)
   -  if not, expand the market and see whether on this expanded market
      a hypothetical monopolist would be able to profitable raise prices

substitution
------------

-  *demand side substitution*: if consumers would switch from bananas to
   kiwis after the price increase, the question becomes whether bananas
   and kiwis together form a relevant market
-  *supply side substitution*: if suppliers of banana liquor would start
   to sell bananas after the price increase, question becomes whether
   the combined market of bananas and banana liquor form a relevant
   market
-  *geographic market*: if consumers would start to buy bananas in
   Belgium after the price increase, the question becomes whether
   bananas in the Netherlands and Belgium form a relevant market
-  question is: is the market under consideration worth monopolizing?
-  relevant market is smallest set of products worth monopolizing

SSNIP test
----------

-  this is known as SSNIP test: small but significant non-transitory
   increase in prices

   -  "small but significant" is often taken to mean 5-10%
   -  "non-transitory": if this could be profitably done for 5 days
      only, the market is not worth monopolizing

-  in economic terms, relevant question concerns elasticities

   -  if price of :math:`x` is increased by 10%, by which percentage
      does demand fall? e.g. because consumers buy outside the region
   -  if drop in demand is big, price rise is not profitable; market for
      :math:`x` is not worth monopolizing
   -  or by which percentage does supply increase?

fallacies
---------

-  applying SSNIP test can lead to two "famous mistakes":

   -  *toothless fallacy*: marginal vs average consumer
   -  *cellophane fallacy*: starting point for price increase

toothless fallacy
-----------------

-  Commission in United Brands case: defining relevant market on the
   basis of the average consumer
-  Commission argued that very young and very old (those without teeth)
   did not consider other fruit a substitute for bananas
-  Commission concluded that bananas is a relevant market
-  however, when a (hypothetical) monopolist raises its price, question
   is not whether average consumer moves away, but whether marginal
   consumer substitutes away
-  if enough consumers *at the margin* substitute away, price increase
   is not profitable (although a number of consumer may be captive)

other examples
--------------

-  some people do not like sparkling water; for them still and sparkling
   water are not substitutes

   -  yet, still and sparkling water are on same relevant market if
      enough consumers (at the margin) switch from still to sparkling if
      the price of still water is increased by 10%

-  aftermarkets: cheap ink-jet printer of brand :math:`X` but cartridges
   are sold by :math:`X` at a high price

   -  do cartridges of :math:`X` form a relevant market
   -  probably not: although you will be stuck if :math:`X` increases
      price, buyers of new printers substitute away from :math:`X`
      because its cartridges are so expensive
   -  buyers of new printers are the marginal consumers
   -  if enough marginal consumers switch away from :math:`X`, rise in
      cartridge prices is not profitable
   -  if so, market for :math:`X` cartridges is not a relevant market

-----------
	  
-  are Rolex and Casio watches in the same market?

   -  some people argue they are not because they sell at completely
      different prices and are of completely different quality
   -  correct question: do consumers at the margin switch from Rolex to
      Casio if price of Rolex watches is increased by 10%
   -  CES utility function
      :math:`u(x,y)=(a x^\theta + b   y^\theta)^{1/\theta}`
   -  whether goods are substitutes is determined by :math:`\theta`
   -  if :math:`a >> b` then price of :math:`X` will be higher than
      price of :math:`Y`

cellophane fallacy
------------------

-  SSNIP test considers price increase of 5-10%, but from which
   benchmark?
-  depends on the question that you want to answer
-  benchmark price differs between merger cases and Article 101, 102
   cases
-  definition of relevant market is different for different questions
-  merger case: whether the merger between two firms leads to price
   increase

   -  question is whether at current prices merged firm has enough
      market power to raise prices
   -  benchmark price is current price on the market

-  abuse of a dominant position case: current price not necessarily the right
   benchmark

cellophane case
---------------

-  US case: Du Pont argued that cellophane was not a separate relevant
   market

   -  empirical evidence showed that it competed closely with other
      packaging materials such as aluminium foil and wax paper

-  Du Pont sole supplier of cellophane
-  on the wider market of packaging materials it had a smaller market
   share
-  US Supreme Court agreed that because of these other packaging
   materials Du Pont could not increase prices further
-  from this it does not follow that Du Pont did not have market power

   -  as a monopolist Du Pont had increased the price of cellophane to
      such an extent that other (inferior) packaging materials now
      became substitutes

-  observation that Du Pont's cellophane did compete with these other
   materials strongly suggests that Du Pont did abuse its market power
   by charging excessive prices for cellophane

benchmark price
---------------

-  in abuse case, current price level is not necessarily right benchmark
   for SSNIP test
-  sometimes take competitive price (or the price prevailing under
   effective or workable competition) as a benchmark
-  Du Pont as monopolist was able to raise price of cellophane
   profitably by 10% from the competitive price
-  if you try to determine whether a firm has abused her market power by
   raising prices, relevant market should be determined with competitive
   prices as benchmark (not current prices)
-  recall that a profit maximizing monopolist cannot profitably increase
   her price by 10% at current prices

concentration and market power
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _concentration:

market share
------------

-  tendency among lawyers to interpret high market share as a signal of
   market power
-  not necessarily correct:

   -  two firms :math:`1,2` producing a homogenous good
   -  :math:`p = 1- (q_1+q_2)`
   -  firm's marginal costs: :math:`c_1=0,c_2=c< 0.5`
   -  Cournot competition implies (*check*)
      :math:`q_1^C =   \frac{1+c}{3},q_2^C = \frac{1-2c}{3},p^C=\frac{1+c}{3}`
   -  Bertrand competition: :math:`q_1^B=1-c,q_2^B=0,p^B=c`
   -  Bertrand outcome is more competitive than Cournot
   -  Bertrand market is more concentrated than Cournot market
   -  lack of competition under Cournot allows less efficient firm 2 to
      enter
   -  high concentration can be sign of intense competition

summary
-------

-  in this lecture we have seen:

   -  how EU competition law is structured
   -  why we need CA and what its objectives are (can be)
   -  what the welfare losses are due to monopoly/market power
   -  why market power is not always bad
   -  why high concentration does not always signal market power
   -  ways in which firms create market power
   -  how to define relevant market and avoid two fallacies
