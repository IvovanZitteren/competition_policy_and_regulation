Mergers and Acquisitions
========================

.. _Mergers:

- When firms in the same (relevant) market merge, the industry becomes
  more concentrated; this can lead to higher prices via 

    - unilateral effects, single firm dominance
    - coordinated effects, collective/joint dominance

- efficiency defence
- vertical and conglomerate mergers lead to concerns about foreclosure and range
  (portfolio) effects
- efficiency offence
- Remedies
- European practice


Unilateral effects in horizontal mergers
----------------------------------------

- When firms produce substitutes, incentive to raise price after merger
- When firms produce complements, incentive to reduce price
- Factors affecting unilateral market power:

  - industry concentration, market shares merging firms, entry, buyer
    power, failing firm defence 

- Mergers in the new economy
- Bidding markets

- Effect of horizontal merger on price

    - Consider a city with three grocery stores \\(A,B,C\\)
    - Now \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) merge and there are no efficiency gains
    - Then we expect the price to go up:

        - Before the merger if \\(A\\) considered a price rise, it
          realized that some of its customers would go to \\(B\\) (and \\(C\\))
        - but now the loss of customers to \\(B\\) is no longer bad for the merged grocery's profits

    - Hence there is less reason to keep prices low and we expect prices to go up
	- If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) sell complements, we expect prices to go
	  down because now \\(A\\) takes into account that a lower price increases the sales of \\(B\\) 


- Factors influencing the likelihood of a price rise
		
    - industry concentration: if there a 100 firms in the industry
      with equal market share and two of them merge, the effect on the price is minimal
    - market shares of merging firms: if two small firms merge, this
      has a smaller effect than when the two biggest firms in the sector merge

        - In the US a screening is used on the Herfindahl index and the change in this index; Motta page 235

    - But market share and concentration is not sufficient:

        - High concentration may be due to intense competition (see :ref:`concentration`)
        - It does not capture the "closeness" of competition within a relevant market:
        - If there are 4 firms in a market \\(A,B,C,D\\) and most
          consumers of \\(A\\) say that their second choice would be \\(B\\)
          and consumers of \\(B\\) have \\(A\\) as their second choice, then a
          merger between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is more likely to lead to higher
          prices than when consumers consider each of the other three
          a good alternative
        - Sometimes the diversion ratio is calculated to capture this:
          diversion ratio from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) is the proportion of sales
          lost by \\(A\\) when \\(p_A\\) increases that are captured by \\(B\\) 

    - Ease of entry: if it is easy for new firms to enter, merged firm
      cannot raise price as it will attract entrants into the
      industry; if "hit-and-run" entry is possible, no reason at all
      to worry about the price effects of a merger 
    - US guidelines consider entry to be a check on the merged firm if
      entry can affect prices in the relevant market within two years
    - Demand factors: can consumers easily switch away to a new
      product if the price goes up? If switching costs are low, demand
      is relatively elastic and scope for price increase limited
    - Buyer power: If the merged firm supplies a limited number of
      powerful buyers, the scope for price increase is limited as well
      (e.g. buyers can threaten to switch supplier; sponsor the entry
      of a new supplier; vertically integrate with a supplier to secure their own supply)
    - Failing firm defence: suppose a firm is about to go bankrupt and
      another firm takes over this firm, then one can argue that the
      take over cannot be anticompetitive since the firm would have
      exited the industry anyway: merger has no effect on the number of firms active in the market
    - Intuitively, it seems a waste to let the failing firm's assets
      idle after it leaves the industry
    - In Kali-Salz three criteria were formulated for a failing firm defence to be valid:

        - acquired firm would in the near future have been forced out
          of the market if not taken over by another firm (failing firm)
        - there is not an alternative buyer of the failing firm that
          causes less anti-competitive concern (then a merger with
          this firm would be preferred from a competition policy point of view)
        - acquiring firm would get failing firm's market share if it
          is forced to exit (if not, i.e. if sales of the failing firm
          would be distributed equally over the other firms in the
          market, exit of this firm may keep concentration lower than the take over)

- Mergers in the new economy
			
    - In sectors that are characterized by a high degree of innovation
      and network effects, there are two considerations which make the
      framework above less relevant: 
    - Is competition best described as "in" the market or "for" the market:

        - If competition is "in" the market, the analysis above applies
        - with competition "for" the market, concentration measures
          are less informative: if network effects cause one standard
          to prevail in a market, high market concentration is not very informative
        - concern here is whether the merger leads to a standard being
          adopted that is not efficient; e.g. suppose there are three
          standards in the market produced by resp. firms \\(A,B,C\\),
          each with market share \\(1/3\\) 
        - now firms \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) merge and decide to make their products compatible
        - the increase in the network of \\(AB\\) can "tip" the market in
          favor of \\(AB\\) even though the \\(C\\) standard could be superior
        - merger of \\(AB\\) should be abolished in this case

    - Is the sector characterized by price competition or product competition? In the latter case the worry is not that the merger
      will lead to higher prices but to a lower rate of innovation as
      firms reduce R&D (instead of reducing production) 

- Bidding markets

    - An example of a bidding market is the construction sector where
      firms bid for projects, like parts of the construction of the Betuwe
      lijn, the high speed train connection between Amsterdam and Paris etc.
    - Here concentration is also not very informative as it does not
      capture the "closeness" of firms in the following sense
    - suppose that there are 10 firms \\(A,B,C,...J\\) with equal market
      shares and \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) want to merge
    - If it is the case that for each project won by \\(A\\), firm \\(B\\) was the
      second lowest bidder and similarly for projects won by \\(B\\), firm \\(A\\) was runner up
    - then the merger of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) should be expected to lead to bigger
      price increases than in the case where any of the other 8 firms was
      the second lowest bidder.


Coordinated effects in horizontal mergers
-----------------------------------------	  

- Merger may change market structure such that it becomes easier for
  firms to (tacitly) collude
- Although merger does not allow a single firm to raise its price,
  collectively it may become easier for firms to raise price
- Difference with unilateral effects is that with unilateral effects
  the merged firm can increase its price (no matter what competitors
  do), with coordinated effects price rise is only profitable if other
  firms raise their price as well 
- Test for coordinated effects:

    - internal factors
    - external factors (see the :ref:`list  <collusion>` of factors facilitating collusion)
    - how does merger change things?

	  
- Internal and external factors:

    - Internal factors: are characteristics in the industry such that
      firms are able to reach a tacit understanding to limit
      competition and sustain this 

        - small number of firms
        - cross ownership between firms
        - orders arrive with high frequency
        - demand is stable
        - transparency in the market, e.g. due to the use of RPM or
          information exchange is easy (organized by trade
          association) 
        - goods are homogenous
        - firms are symmetric
        - multi market contact
        - excess capacity

    - External factors: do the firms collectively have market power to raise prices:

        - ease of entry: if it is easy for new firms to enter,
          existing firms cannot profitably raise their price;
          collective dominance is not a concern 
        - supply-side substitutability
        - large buyers that can counteract price increases due to
          collective dominance
        - maverick firm that does not want to collude but instead
          behaves aggressively (think of Easy Jet, Easy Cruise etc.)
			
- How does the merger change things?

- Even if all the (internal and external) factors above point to the
  possibility of collusion, this is not enough to forbid the merger on
  the basis of collective dominance
- One should also argue why before the merger tacit collusion was not
  feasible while after the merger it is:

    - merger may create firms that are more symmetric than before (in
      terms of production capacity, marginal costs, portfolio of
      products etc.) and hence facilitates collusion
    - merger removes the maverick firm from the market by acquiring
      it; firm that blocked collusion before disappears and hence
      collusion is easier to sustain 


Efficiency defence
------------------

- If the merger leads to a reduction in *marginal costs*, there
  is a tendency for firms to price lower (monopolist with lower costs
  chooses a lower price as well)
- If the reduction in marginal costs is big enough, this can dominate
  the market power effect of the merger and lead to lower prices
- Sources of efficiency gains after a merger: economies of scale and
  scope; reallocation of assets to more productive uses within the
  merged entity; learning from the other firm's best practice;
  reallocating output over plants to reduce costs 
- There are some problems with this efficiency defence:

    - It is easy to promise efficiency gains by firms, but in practice
      they are usually not realized (competition authority lacks the
      information to verify the claims of efficiency gains)
    - As noted above, if the efficiency gains lead to a more symmetric
      structure in the industry it may facilitate collusion
    - if the efficiency gains can also be realized without the merger,
      they cannot be used as a defence of the merger

- Under a consumer welfare standard the efficiency gains need to be
  bigger to justify a merger than under a total welfare standard, as
  in the former case the price has to actually decrease after the
  merger for consumers to benefit (consumer surplus to increase)
- Under a total welfare standard reductions in fixed costs (by
  eliminating the duplication of overhead costs) can also justify a
  merger while this cannot happen under a consumer welfare standard
  (as fixed costs have no effect on the price of existing firms)
- If efficiency gains are big enough, other firms in the industry will
  lose from the merger; hence competitors complaining about a merger
  is often suspicious; competition policy should not protect competitors

	
Vertical mergers
----------------

- A vertical merger like vertical restraints can raise welfare by internalizing
  externalities between upstream and downstream firms (like double marginalization)
- But such a merger can also lead to a reduction in welfare, e.g. when
  it leads to (partial) foreclosure (see :ref:`vertical restraints <foreclosure>`) and thus raises rivals' costs
- Even in cases where the vertical merger would lead to efficiency gains for the merged
  firm, the Commission has held this against the firms: efficiency offence
- underlying idea is that the cost advantage leads to the exit of competitors and
  hence to higher prices in the long run
- However, before such a predatory pricing theory makes sense, one needs to show
  that prices can go up after the other firms have left (e.g. there must be high
  barriers to entry etc.)
- further, the other firms can perhaps merge as well or reduce their costs in
  other ways
- Instead of prohibiting the merger on the basis of efficiency offence one can
  also allow the merger and use Article 102 later on to prevent the abuse of a dominant
  position
- Principle here should again be: vertical merger is no problem as long as there
  is enough inter-brand competition


Conglomerate mergers
--------------------

- merger between two firms that are neither in the same relevant market not
  vertically related
- Think, for instance, of a firm \\(B\\) brewing beer merging with a firm \\(C\\)
  producing crisps
- Commission has identified the following range/portfolio effects:

  - merged firm is attractive to retailers as it offers a range of products
  - merger leads to economies of scale and scope
  - merger creates possibilities for tying and bundling
  - merger increases the threat of refusal to supply

- First two effects mainly harm competitors, not competition; other firms should
  try to get similar advantages
- Fourth argument does not make much sense as the outside options for the
  retailers (in either beer or crisps) have not changed
- Tying and bundling can be a problem if one of the firms holds a monopoly (or at
  least dominant) position in its market; as shown :ref:`here <tying>`  it
  is then possible (under conditions) to leverage market power from one market to the next
- Commission has used this type of argument in the Tetra Laval/Sidel case (where
  the Commission argued that the merger would have allowed Tetra Laval to leverage its
  dominance in carton packing and equipment to achieve a dominant position in the
  market for plastic bottling machines)
- CFI has criticized this decision as Commission did not show that merger
  created overwhelming advantage for Tetra Laval nor that competitors were not able
  to respond to merger by creating similar advantages
- Commission also used this portfolio power theory to prohibit the GE/Honeywell
  merger that had already been cleared in the US by the DOJ; in the US the decision was
  interpreted as protecting competitors instead of protecting competition


Remedies
--------

- Commission can allow a merger, prohibit it or allow the merger if certain
  remedies are adopted
- Two categories of remedies:
	
    - structural remedies: merging firms are forced to sell some assets (e.g.
      divest some products or divisions)
    - behavioral remedies: merging firms commit themselves not to engage in
      certain (abusive) practices or to license a certain technology to rivals

- Structural remedies can be used to solve portfolio problems or reduce excess
  capacity available to the merged firm
- disadvantage: merged firm divesting assets has an incentive to sell to
  weak competitor who does not form a serious threat; CA lacks information to see
  whether assets go to the right firm; if divestiture turns out to be a
  mistake, hard to turn back
- Behavioral remedies require continuous monitoring by CA or independent party


European practice: Merger Regulation
------------------------------------


- When firms want to merge, they have to notify the Merger Task Force (if the
  merger has a Community dimension, otherwise firms go to the national CA)
- Within one month from the notification the Commission decides whether the
  merger is cleared right away or whether further investigation (Phase II) is needed
- Phase II investigation can last 4 months; three possible outcomes: cleared,
  cleared subject to remedy, prohibition of merger
- If merger is prohibited, firms can appeal Commission's decision at CFI
- However, appeal can take up to three years; usually even if firms win in the European Courts,
  commercial rationale for merger has disappeared
- Europe used to have a dominance test for mergers; however some mergers can be
  welfare reducing (and should thus be prohibited) even though they do not create or
  strengthen a dominant position
- The US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK have SLC test (substantial lessening
  of competition)
- Commission introduced in 2004 a new Merger Regulation (for horizontal mergers)
  based on a similar idea that merger should not "significantly impede effective competition"


Summary
-------

- Horizontal mergers and acquisitions can raise prices (and
  reduce consumer welfare) through either unilateral or
  coordinated effects
- Firms can defend the merger by claiming that marginal costs will go
  down to such an extent that prices will actually fall
- Other ways to argue that the merger will not lead to
  higher prices include: low concentration, merger involves two small firms,
  low entry barriers, consumers can easily switch to other
  suppliers, strong buyer power, failing firm defence
- Vertical mergers, like vertical restraints, can create
  efficiencies that lead to lower prices
- However, vertical mergers (again, like restraints) can
  also lead to foreclosure and higher prices
- Even when there are efficiencies the Commission sometimes
  holds this against firms as an efficiency offence
- Conglomerate mergers can be bad for welfare because of
  portfolio effects if the merger creates the possibilities for
  bundling and tying
