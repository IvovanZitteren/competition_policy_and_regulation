* This video describes what role regulation can play if there is only one firm in the market:

`part 1 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/k2D7aJHSQcCrQZpXkb1FZ2eE>`_

* We take a look at a model of a regulated firm, starting with the underlying assumptions and payoffs:

`part 2 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/l2PQOlcXRCNWTR6KtQ4AsaoY>`_

* We study first best, the case of no asymmetric information:

`part 3 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/Z1ZpoUYoMi6WNS5RgjFWI8GN>`_

* Followed by the second best, the case where the regulator does not know how efficient the firm is (asymmetric information):

`part 4 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/Y1xjIdweV5TGWMbMUpJ01jUG>`_

* We simplify the planner's optimization problem:

`part 5 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/R1LLXJfLJlOAOpkYWTqnVCCI>`_

* We find the optimal cost levels and discuss the competition increasing policy option to threaten the firm to shut down: 

`part 6 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/lcCmrVRZhQPdKVsXlvhYPlzV>`_

* In this video we discuss the competition increasing policy option of yardstick competition:

`part 7 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/h8WfDKMkDpmQVdjsQTMqBIXk>`_

* Last, we shortly discuss policy implications of this lecture:

`part 8 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/i2FIdKcpU9uafXXMaQEtUsMr>`_
