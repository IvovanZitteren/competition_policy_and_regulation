* This video points out the importance of the relation between competition and innovation, and takes a look at ex ante vs ex post competition:

`part 1 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/qYkdjNhGlTnfaWVML8QE5k96>`_

* We study a model where competition raises innovation if firms maximize profits (company ran by owners) and if firms are ran by managers:

`part 2 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/G2HMlFKfTWNXSYYTKL6ZRrKR>`_

* In this video arguments against the positive relation between competition and innovation are provided by the inverted U duopoly model by Aghion et al. (2005) and the Schumpeter argument:

`part 3 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/nYphnWGFsi5KUGWVwogSHqaN>`_

* We study the duopoly model by Segal and Whinston (2007), which questions whether competition policy should be different in innovative industries:

`part 4 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/Y2UVVfpRGVqlkLTUQUMArapR>`_

* We continue studying the model by Segal and Whinston (2007):

`part 5 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/M1RehWKF9UmCUZkOeiTK0I1S>`_

* This video shows how exclusion can be modeled and provides policy implications of the models studied so far: 

`part 6 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/y2Sa9RSLSpJsIVnkOVJ9TeOx>`_

* We discuss take a first look at intellectual property rights, study current US law and trade secrecy:

`part 7 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/zlCUTFLZN9hqkKCPEij6B5H3>`_

* We consider a model that explains the trade off between optimal patent duration and breadth:

`part 8 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/p1aQCvkYZDqdWb6KsHWgnEPu>`_

* Last we consider a model that derives the optimal profitability of patents and conclude with policy implications:

`part 9 <https://tilburgutube.uvt.nl/asset/player/i2ZLSka94W7TIYKITR3qQTjO>`_


* how can we dsegin IP to stimulate innovation and minimize inefficiencies :
