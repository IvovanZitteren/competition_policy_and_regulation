Rules of the Game

Overview of the course
----------------------

In this course we explain how economic methods are used to decide
cases in competition policy and in regulatory policy. The course
consists of a sequence of lectures, a set of 3 (mandatory) homework
assignments and a final exam. Below, we describe the detailed contents
of each of the lectures.

For more details on the assignments, see the "Assignments" section on
Blackboard. To stimulate active class discussion, students will
regularly be asked to either do preparatory reading before a class or
prepare exercises that are discussed in class. Some lectures contain
exercises (either from the Motta book or new ones in the lecture file)
that will be discussed in class.

Here we provide detailed contents of the lectures and the associated
literature.

-  Introduction: We provide an overview of the field and of what
   students can expect to learn during the course. We discuss the aims
   of competition policy and the instruments that competition agencies
   have at their disposal. We review some basic economic concepts
   relevant for competition policy: Consumer Surplus, Producer Surplus
   and Total Welfare; Allocative, Productive and Dynamic Efficiency. We
   also define the concept of Market Power and discuss the relationships
   between Market Power, the structure of the market and the different
   types of efficiency. *Literature*: Motta, Chapters 1,2; Competition
   website of the European Commission.

-  Agreements between Firms (Art 101 TFEU): Agreements between firms
   that restrict competition are forbidden, unless they are efficiency
   enhancing and are benefiting consumers. In this lecture, we provide a
   general overview of the different types of agreements. We distinguish
   between horizontal and vertical agreements and address the following
   questions: when do agreements restrict competition?, when can they be
   classified as cartels?, when are they allowed, on the basis of Art
   101.3 TFEU? We also introduce collusion and why it is bad for
   consumers and for total welfare. We determine factors that facilitate
   collusion and ways for the government to discourage it. *Literature*:
   Motta, Chapter 4.

-  Horizontal Mergers: in this lecture it is explained why mergers need
   to be notified to antitrust authorities. We will in the meantime
   introduce the EU Merger regulation and the EU Horizontal Mergers
   Guidelines. We will discuss why a merger can raise concerns of
   unilateral and/or coordinated effects. *Literature*: Motta, Chapter 5.

-  Vertical Agreements: Vertical agreements are agreements between firms
   that are active at different levels of the value chain, that is,
   between producers and distributors. Such agreements are treated more
   leniently than horizontal agreements. In this lecture, we describe
   different types of vertical agreements and explain why they are
   treated more leniently. We explain the double marginalization problem
   and also discuss whether or not Resale Price Maintenance (RPM) should
   be allowed. Vertical agreements can also be anti-competitive,
   especially when either the producer or the distributor has market
   power and forces exclusive contracts. We discuss concerns of
   foreclosure and the conditions under which these are justified.
   *Literature*: Motta, Chapter 6.

-  Article 102: Abuse of a dominant position (two lectures). Article 102
   TFEU forbids a firm with a dominant position to abuse that position.
   But what does it mean for a firm to have a dominant position, and
   when is behavior abusive? In this lecture we introduce these issues.
   We also distinguish between dominant positions that are permanent (in
   which case regulation is called for) and dominant positions that may
   be eroded by market forces themselves (in which case competition
   policy may suffice as an instrument). We discuss under which
   conditions the competition laws force a firm to supply inputs to its
   rivals. Further, we analyze predatory pricing and exclusive dealing.
   Finally, we discuss tying and bundling. We also discuss the various
   antitrust cases that Microsoft has been involved in. *Literature*:
   Motta, Chapter 7.

-  Innovation: most of the lectures focus on the effects of competition
   on static efficiency. In this lecture, we analyze the effects on
   dynamic efficiency: innovation. Does more intense competition lead to
   more or to less innovation? Patents create a (temporary) monopoly
   position; is this desirable? How do we trade off the effects of this
   market power on static and dynamic efficiency?

-  Regulating a monopolist: if there is only one firm in the market,
   competition may not restrain this firm's behaviour. The government
   can then decide to regulate the firm. We introduce mechanism design
   to analyze the optimal way to regulate a monopolist.

-  Competition in health care markets: countries like the US and the
   Netherlands have private firms competing in health care markets. This
   introduces a number of competition policy issues that we will analyze
   in this lecture. For instance, should a vertical merger between an
   insurer and a hospital be allowed?

.. Web-lectures
.. ------------
.. 
.. In the weeks that Jan teaches, you can watch screencasts of the
.. lectures at home on your computer *before* that week's
.. lecture.
.. 
.. The first lecture can be found here: `<screencasts/Article101/Article101_1.m4v>`_
.. 
.. In the "live" lecture, you can ask questions that you have
.. about the web-lecture. Hence, it is important that you watch the
.. web-lecture beforehand. The live lecture will further be used to teach
.. you some python that you will need for two of the assignments. Further,
.. we go over exercises to practice for the exam.
.. 

Home work assignments
---------------------

There will be 3 assignments. Students are allowed
to form teams to do the assignments; however, the maximum number of
students per group is 2. Students will not need to communicate the
teams. They will simply need to write two names and exam numbers on an
assignment. The TA will assume that names appearing on the same
assignment will form a group from that point onwards. Importantly,
students should stick to the same partner for all assignments. In case
of serious disagreements with the partner, students can ask the
lecturer and the TA (by email) to be allowed to do the assignments
alone from that point onwards. However, in no case they will be allowed
to form a new team with another student.

.. 
.. Assignments are due on Thursdays in the weeks mentioned in the schedule
.. above.
.. 
.. ???no email addresses on line???
.. 
.. You have to email your solutions to Xue Xu:
.. `x.xu\_1@tilburguniversity.edu <x.xu_1@tilburguniversity.edu>`__. The
.. deadline for submission is 16:00 on Thursdays on the weeks indicated in
.. the table above. One submission per team is sufficient but it should
.. bear the names of all team members. If we receive several files from the
.. members of a team, we will randomly pick one and disregard all others.
.. The consequence of a submission after the deadline (no matter by how
.. little the deadline was missed) is that the authors will receive a grade
.. of one for the respective assignment. All members of the team are
.. responsible for making sure that the assignment is handed-in on time. A
.. submission after the deadline will affect all team members equally
.. irrespective of who bears the fault among the team members.
.. 

Assignments are posted on BB.



Final grade
-----------

Your final grade is the unweighted average of the assignments and the
final exam. Let :math:`A_i` denote your grade on assignment :math:`i`
and :math:`E` your grade on the exam. Then the final grade :math:`F` is
determined by

.. math::

   \label{eq:1}
   F = (A_1+A_2+A_3+E)/4

Hence the assignments are mandatory and very important!

The grades of the assignments can only be used in this academic year
2015-2016. Next year a student does the whole course again including the
assignments.

It is important that you understand things; not learn things by
heart. Therefore, at the final (written) exam, you are allowed to
bring a handwritten A4 page with notes. You can write on this page
what you want: equations, law texts, poetry.
