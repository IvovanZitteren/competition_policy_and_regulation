<p>Assignments are due on Thursdays in the weeks indicated in the table above at 12:00 (noon).</p>
<p>Here we provide detailed contents of the lectures and the associated
literature.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Introduction: We provide an overview of the field and of what
students can expect to learn during the course. We discuss the aims
of competition policy and the instruments that competition agencies
have at their disposal. We review some basic economic concepts
relevant for competition policy: Consumer Surplus, Producer Surplus
and Total Welfare; Allocative, Productive and Dynamic Efficiency. We
also define the concept of Market Power and discuss the relationships
between Market Power, the structure of the market and the different
types of efficiency. <em>Literature</em>: Motta, Chapters 1,2.</li>
<li>Agreements between Firms (Article 101): Agreements between firms
that restrict competition are forbidden, unless they are efficiency
enhancing and are benefiting consumers. In this lecture, we provide a
general overview of the different types of agreements. We distinguish
between horizontal and vertical agreements and address the following
questions: when do agreements restrict competition?, when can they be
classified as cartels?, when are they allowed, on the basis of Article
101.3? We also introduce collusion and why it is bad for
consumers and for total welfare. We determine factors that facilitate
collusion and ways for the government to discourage it. <em>Literature</em>:
Motta, Chapter 4.</li>
<li>Vertical Agreements: Vertical agreements are agreements between firms
that are active at different levels of the value chain, that is,
between producers and distributors. Such agreements are treated more
leniently than horizontal agreements. In this lecture, we describe
different types of vertical agreements and explain why they are
treated more leniently. We explain the double marginalization problem
and also discuss whether or not Resale Price Maintenance (RPM) should
be allowed. Vertical agreements can also be anti-competitive,
especially when either the producer or the distributor has market
power and forces exclusive contracts. We discuss concerns of
foreclosure and the conditions under which these are justified.
<em>Literature</em>: Motta, Chapter 6.</li>
<li>Article 102: Abuse of a dominant position (two lectures). Article 102
forbids a firm with a dominant position to abuse that position.
But what does it mean for a firm to have a dominant position, and
when is behavior abusive? In this lecture we introduce these issues.
We also distinguish between dominant positions that are permanent (in
which case regulation is called for) and dominant positions that may
be eroded by market forces themselves (in which case competition
policy may suffice as an instrument). We discuss under which
conditions the competition laws force a firm to supply inputs to its
rivals. Further, we analyze predatory pricing and exclusive dealing.
Finally, we discuss tying and bundling. We also discuss the various
antitrust cases that Microsoft has been involved in. <em>Literature</em>:
Motta, Chapter 7.</li>
<li>Horizontal Mergers: in this lecture it is explained why mergers need
to be notified to antitrust authorities. We will discuss why and when a merger can raise concerns of
unilateral and/or coordinated effects. <em>Literature</em>: Motta, Chapter 5.</li>
<li>Innovation: most of the lectures focus on the effects of competition
on static efficiency. In this lecture, we analyze the effects on
dynamic efficiency: innovation. Does more intense competition lead to
more or to less innovation? Patents create a (temporary) monopoly
position; is this desirable? How do we trade off the effects of this
market power on static and dynamic efficiency?</li>
<li>Regulating a monopolist: if there is only one firm in the market,
competition may not restrain this firm&#8217;s behaviour. The government
can then decide to regulate the firm. We introduce mechanism design
to analyze the optimal way to regulate a monopolist.</li>
<li>Competition in health care markets: countries like the US and the
Netherlands have private firms competing in health care markets. This
introduces a number of competition policy issues that we will analyze
in this lecture. For instance, should a vertical merger between an
insurer and a hospital be allowed?</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="web-lectures">
<h2>Web-lectures<a class="headerlink" href="#web-lectures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The competition policy lectures can be viewed on line. Each lecture page contains the links to the screencasts.</p>
<p>Also we use <a class="reference external" href="https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/chapter-1-python-basics?ex=1">datacamp</a> weblectures for python.
The schedule above suggests a way to go through these lectures so that you finish them in time for your first assignment.</p>
<p>In the &#8220;live&#8221; lecture, you can ask questions that you have
about the web-lecture. Hence, it is important that you watch the
web-lecture beforehand. Also the web-lecture will be useful to understand the exercises which allow you to practice for the exam. These exercises are discussed in the live lecture.</p>
<p>Finally, the live lecture will be used to teach python which you need for the assignments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="home-work-assignments">
<h2>Home work assignments<a class="headerlink" href="#home-work-assignments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There will be 2 assignments. Students are allowed
to form teams to do the assignments; however, the maximum number of
students per group is 2. Students will not need to communicate the
teams. They will simply need to write two names and exam numbers on each
assignment. The TA will assume that names appearing on the same
assignment will form a group from that point onwards. Importantly,
students should stick to the same partner for both assignments. In case
of serious disagreements with the partner, students can ask the
lecturer and the TA (by email) to be allowed to do the assignments
alone from that point onwards. However, in no case they will be allowed
to form a new team with another student.</p>
<p>Assignments are due on Thursdays in the weeks mentioned in the schedule
above. The
deadline for submission is 12:00 on Thursdays on the weeks indicated in
the table above. One submission per team is sufficient but it should
bear the names of all team members. If we receive several files from the
members of a team, we will randomly pick one and disregard all others.
The consequence of a submission after the deadline (no matter by how
little the deadline was missed) is that the authors will receive a grade
of one (1) for the respective assignment. All members of the team are
responsible for making sure that the assignment is handed in on time. A
submission after the deadline will affect all team members equally
irrespective of who bears the fault among the team members.</p>
<p>Assignments will be posted on BB.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="class-participation">
<h2>Class participation<a class="headerlink" href="#class-participation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In class we focus on questions from previous exams. Students are
supposed to prepare the class by watching the lectures and studying
the material beforehand, including making the questions to be
discussed. We will call out student names to answer questions. What we
are looking for is that you prepared for class; not necessarily that
you give the right answer. If we believe that you prepared for class,
we give you 1 point; if you didn&#8217;t prepare (or are absent from class)
when called to answer a question, you get 0.</p>
<p>Your grade for partipation <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is determined as
follows. Suppose, we called your name <span class="math">\(n\)</span> times during the
semester and summing over the grades (0&#8217;s and 1&#8217;s) you received <span class="math">\(x\)</span>
points, then</p>
<div class="math">
\[P = 25*x/n\]</div>
<p>Hence <span class="math">\(P\)</span> lies between 0 and 25.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to make sure that we call out your name
during the semester (we will publish the list that we use on
Blackboard; so you can check). If <span class="math">\(n=0\)</span> for you, then
<span class="math">\(P=0\)</span> as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="final-grade">
<h2>Final grade<a class="headerlink" href="#final-grade" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your final grade is the unweighted average of your participation in
class, the two assignments and the
final exam. Let <span class="math">\(P\)</span> denote the grade for your participation in
class, <span class="math">\(A_i\)</span> denote your grade on assignment <span class="math">\(i\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(E\)</span> your grade on the exam. Then the final grade <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is
determined by</p>
<div class="math">
\[\label{eq:1}
F = (P+A_1+A_2+E)/4\]</div>
<p>Hence class participation and assignments are mandatory and very important!</p>
<p>The grades for participation and the assignments can only be used in this academic year
2016-2017. Next year a student does the whole course again including the
assignments and class participation.</p>
<p>For the exam, it is important that you understand things; not learn them by
heart. Therefore, at the (written) exam, you are allowed to
bring a handwritten A4 page with notes. You can write on this page
what you want: equations, law texts, poetry.</p>
<p>The exam is planned at T.B.A.</p>
