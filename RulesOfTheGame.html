<h2>Overview of the course<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-the-course" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this course we explain how economic methods are used to decide
cases in competition policy and in regulatory policy. The course
consists of a sequence of lectures, a set of 3 (mandatory) homework
assignments and a final exam. Below, we describe the detailed contents
of each of the lectures.</p>
<p>For more details on the assignments, see the &#8220;Assignments&#8221; section on
Blackboard. To stimulate active class discussion, students will
regularly be asked to either do preparatory reading before a class or
prepare exercises that are discussed in class. Some lectures contain
exercises (either from the Motta book or new ones in the lecture file)
that will be discussed in class.</p>
<p>Here we provide detailed contents of the lectures and the associated
literature.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Introduction: We provide an overview of the field and of what
students can expect to learn during the course. We discuss the aims
of competition policy and the instruments that competition agencies
have at their disposal. We review some basic economic concepts
relevant for competition policy: Consumer Surplus, Producer Surplus
and Total Welfare; Allocative, Productive and Dynamic Efficiency. We
also define the concept of Market Power and discuss the relationships
between Market Power, the structure of the market and the different
types of efficiency. <em>Literature</em>: Motta, Chapters 1,2; Competition
website of the European Commission.</li>
<li>Agreements between Firms (Art 101 TFEU): Agreements between firms
that restrict competition are forbidden, unless they are efficiency
enhancing and are benefiting consumers. In this lecture, we provide a
general overview of the different types of agreements. We distinguish
between horizontal and vertical agreements and address the following
questions: when do agreements restrict competition?, when can they be
classified as cartels?, when are they allowed, on the basis of Art
101.3 TFEU? We also introduce collusion and why it is bad for
consumers and for total welfare. We determine factors that facilitate
collusion and ways for the government to discourage it. <em>Literature</em>:
Motta, Chapter 4.</li>
<li>Horizontal Mergers: in this lecture it is explained why mergers need
to be notified to antitrust authorities. We will in the meantime
introduce the EU Merger regulation and the EU Horizontal Mergers
Guidelines. We will discuss why a merger can raise concerns of
unilateral and/or coordinated effects. <em>Literature</em>: Motta, Chapter 5.</li>
<li>Vertical Agreements: Vertical agreements are agreements between firms
that are active at different levels of the value chain, that is,
between producers and distributors. Such agreements are treated more
leniently than horizontal agreements. In this lecture, we describe
different types of vertical agreements and explain why they are
treated more leniently. We explain the double marginalization problem
and also discuss whether or not Resale Price Maintenance (RPM) should
be allowed. Vertical agreements can also be anti-competitive,
especially when either the producer or the distributor has market
power and forces exclusive contracts. We discuss concerns of
foreclosure and the conditions under which these are justified.
<em>Literature</em>: Motta, Chapter 6.</li>
<li>Article 102: Abuse of a dominant position (two lectures). Article 102
TFEU forbids a firm with a dominant position to abuse that position.
But what does it mean for a firm to have a dominant position, and
when is behavior abusive? In this lecture we introduce these issues.
We also distinguish between dominant positions that are permanent (in
which case regulation is called for) and dominant positions that may
be eroded by market forces themselves (in which case competition
policy may suffice as an instrument). We discuss under which
conditions the competition laws force a firm to supply inputs to its
rivals. Further, we analyze predatory pricing and exclusive dealing.
Finally, we discuss tying and bundling. We also discuss the various
antitrust cases that Microsoft has been involved in. <em>Literature</em>:
Motta, Chapter 7.</li>
<li>Innovation: most of the lectures focus on the effects of competition
on static efficiency. In this lecture, we analyze the effects on
dynamic efficiency: innovation. Does more intense competition lead to
more or to less innovation? Patents create a (temporary) monopoly
position; is this desirable? How do we trade off the effects of this
market power on static and dynamic efficiency?</li>
<li>Regulating a monopolist: if there is only one firm in the market,
competition may not restrain this firm&#8217;s behaviour. The government
can then decide to regulate the firm. We introduce mechanism design
to analyze the optimal way to regulate a monopolist.</li>
<li>Competition in health care markets: countries like the US and the
Netherlands have private firms competing in health care markets. This
introduces a number of competition policy issues that we will analyze
in this lecture. For instance, should a vertical merger between an
insurer and a hospital be allowed?</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="home-work-assignments">
<h2>Home work assignments<a class="headerlink" href="#home-work-assignments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There will be 3 assignments. Students are allowed
to form teams to do the assignments; however, the maximum number of
students per group is 2. Students will not need to communicate the
teams. They will simply need to write two names and exam numbers on an
assignment. The TA will assume that names appearing on the same
assignment will form a group from that point onwards. Importantly,
students should stick to the same partner for all assignments. In case
of serious disagreements with the partner, students can ask the
lecturer and the TA (by email) to be allowed to do the assignments
alone from that point onwards. However, in no case they will be allowed
to form a new team with another student.</p>
<p>Assignments are posted on BB.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="final-grade">
<h2>Final grade<a class="headerlink" href="#final-grade" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your final grade is the unweighted average of the assignments and the
final exam. Let <span class="math">\(A_i\)</span> denote your grade on assignment <span class="math">\(i\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(E\)</span> your grade on the exam. Then the final grade <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is
determined by</p>
<div class="math">
\[\label{eq:1}
F = (A_1+A_2+A_3+E)/4\]</div>
<p>Hence the assignments are mandatory and very important!</p>
<p>The grades of the assignments can only be used in this academic year
2015-2016. Next year a student does the whole course again including the
assignments.</p>
<p>It is important that you understand things; not learn things by
heart. Therefore, at the final (written) exam, you are allowed to
bring a handwritten A4 page with notes. You can write on this page
what you want: equations, law texts, poetry.</p>
